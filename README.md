How to add to extension:

go to chrome://extensions 
then click developer mode
click load unpacked
then add this folder to extensions
after this enable it
click it and press begin
from there you will put the users cookie that you have taken
(instructions on how to take the cookie is at the top of the google form)

sadly i have not registered with google chrome so i was unable to have it in the store which would make this easier.

if you have any question reach out to me on GitHub (FallenGarden00)

there will be an updated version coming soon sense it may be bugged from time to time
